## Introduction
This mod is a collection of items that I want to expand or enhance using the Thalantyr Item Upgrade Mod.

## Remarks
I am using the `BZ` prefix for my items, as I have not seen it used or referenced prior.

## Items
### Shandalar's Cloak
I wanted to use the lore from Shandalar and source books, and I thought that inthe off chance that a PC manages to defeat Shandalar, it would be a fun reward to give the player a cloak that they can use that looks and behaves kind of like Shandalar. For References to Shandalar, see: [Shandalar on the Forgottem Realms wiki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shandalar). Note: Shandalar has two publications according to the wiki: Baldur's Gate and [Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Volo%27s_Guide_to_the_Sword_Coast).

**Cost:** consumes shandalar's cloak and wardstone; requires 3 protection scrolls from electricity, 2 protection scrolls from fire, and 10,000 gp.


Cloak will be a + 2 protection cloak (+2 AC, +2 saving throws) which also grants 50% electrical resistance and 25% fire resistance.

### Varscona +3
Varscona is a _very_ decent sword in BG, probably _the_ capstone longsword for base BG1. That said, swords especially into SoD need to go into the +3 realm, and I want to allow the PC to take this beauty all the way to ToB. I'll have more mods for item import later.

**Cost:** Upgrades the +2 longsword to +3; requires 1 emerald, 1 cone of cold scroll, 1 lightning bolt scroll, and 5,000 gp.

Varscona +3 deals 1d8+3 slashing, 2d3 cold; with a +3 enchantment and thac0 bonus. It grants % fire resistance and offers a % chance to drain 1 HP on hit.
