## Introduction
This mod is a collection of items that I want to expand or enhance using the Thalantyr Item Upgrade Mod.    

## Items
### Shandalar's Cloak
I wanted to use the lore from Shandalar and source books, and I thought that inthe off chance that a PC manages to defeat Shandalar, it would be a fun reward to give the player a cloak that they can use that looks and behaves kind of like Shandalar. For References to Shandalar, see: [Shandalar on the Forgottem Realms wiki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shandalar). Note: Shandalar has two publications according to the wiki: Baldur's Gate and [Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Volo%27s_Guide_to_the_Sword_Coast).

### Varscona +3
Varscona is a _very_ decent sword in BG, probably _the_ capstone longsword for BG1. That said, swords especially into SoD need to go into the +3 realm, and I want to allow the PC to take this beauty all the way to ToB. I'll have more mods for item import later.
